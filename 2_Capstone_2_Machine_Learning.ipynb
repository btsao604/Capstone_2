We note that from our correlation matrix in our exploratory data analysis, we did not yield highly correlated features. Thus we do not have to worry about redundant features. If we did have a lot of highly correlated features, we would have to perform a feature reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis. With this out of the way, let us start cleaning our data for predictive modelling.\n",

    "The below functions are used to evaluate some key metrics on our predictive modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Confusion Matrix:  This is a 2X2 matrix that helps us visualize the the performance of our algorithm. It will show the amount of true positive (model predicted positive accurately), true negative (model predicted negative accurately), false positive (model inaccurately predicted data to be positive) and false negative (model in accurately predicted data to be negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accuracy Score: Accuracy Score is the amount of true positive and true negative divided by the totals. This measures how accurately we were in predicting an employee leaving as well as employee staying.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ROC curve: This is the receiver operating Characteristic Curve. This is a graphical plot that measures the true positive rate on the Y axis vs the false positive rate on the X axis. A line going through the middle that is represented as Y = X is equivalent to predicting out positively 50% of the time. Thus we would hopefully expect a concave curve against the Y=X line to the left for our model to predict out true positive rate accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. AUC score: This is the area under the ROC curve for the our model. This related to the ROC curve and is measured as the area between our ROC curve and the Y=X. This will range between 0 to 1 with a score of 0 meaning that we have an equivalent model as flipping a coin (50% chance of getting a correct score) and 100% meaning that our model predicted accurately 100% of the time (this will mean we have done something wrong with our data and have overfitted or are using some future variable to predict our outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. F1 score: Measured as 2 X (Precision X Recall) / (Precision + Recall). Where precision = true positives / total positives and recall = true positives / (true positive + false negative). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are great metrics and each have their own significance. In our model, we will be focusing on the AUC score as we want to ensure that our model is predicting out employees that leave (which is our 'positive' in this case) at a good rate - i.e. above 50%."

Random forest will train each tree independently/simultaneously and will make be less proned to overfitting. None the less, this is another algorithm to test out."

    "\n",
    "We have chosen our random forest classifier as our model to go with for hyperparameter tuning. A key note is that the model will learn what parameters are best for prediction, however, hyperparameters (in this case, an example would be the amount of decision trees, how deep the trees should go, etc.) are seleted by data scientists in advance.  There are several wasy of hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual - this is based on intuition/experience/guessing. We would iterate through this process until we run out of patience or are happy with our results.\n",
    "2. Grid Search - we set up a grid of hyperparameter values and work through each combination, train the model and score on the validation data. We would test every single combination of hyper parameters which would be very inefficient.\n",
    "3. Random search - set up a grid of hyperparameter values and select random combinations to train the model and score. The number of search iterations is set based on time/resources.\n",
    "4. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning - use methods such as gradient descent, Bayesian Optimization, or evolutionary algorithms to conduct a guided search for the best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically we would start with a wide array of random search per method 3. For example, we would see if a max depth of 5 layers is enough in our random forest or if we would need a max depth of 20. Afterwards, we would use the grid search method to narrow it down - example being if the random search came up with a max depth of 20, we could test if we would need 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 as the max depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we do not have time for grid search (and it is very similar to random gridsearch), we will only be implementing the random search."
